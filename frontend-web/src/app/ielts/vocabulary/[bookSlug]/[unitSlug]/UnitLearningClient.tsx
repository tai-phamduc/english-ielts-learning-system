      "The plan sounded <strong>well</strong> thought-out to the lion, so he <strong>agreed</strong>, but he also said, \"If you don't come every day, I promise to kill all of you the next day!\" Each day after that, one animal went to the lion so that the lion could eat it. Then, all the other animals were <strong>safe</strong>. Finally, it was the rabbit's turn to go to the lion. The rabbit went very slowly that day, so the lion was <strong>angry</strong> when the rabbit finally <strong>arrived</strong>.",
      "The lion angrily asked the rabbit, \"Why are you late?\"",
      "\"I was <strong>hiding</strong> from another lion in the forest. That lion said he was the king, so I was afraid.\"",
      "The lion told the rabbit, \"I am the only king here! Take me to that other lion, and I will kill him.\"",
      "The rabbit <strong>replied</strong>, \"I will be happy to show you where he lives.\"",
      "The rabbit led the lion to an old well in the middle of the forest. The well was very deep with water at the <strong>bottom</strong>. The rabbit told the lion, \"Look in there. The lion lives at the bottom.\"",
      "When the lion looked in the well, he could see his own face in the water. He thought that was the other lion. Without waiting another <strong>moment</strong>, the lion jumped into the well to <strong>attack</strong> the other lion. He never came out.",
